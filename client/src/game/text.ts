 * Add a Text game object that stays readable under `pixelArt: true`.

 * The game config enables `pixelArt`, which forces NEAREST filtering on
 * every WebGL texture so sprite art stays crisp. Text objects render to
 * an internal canvas and upload it as a texture — with NEAREST that canvas
 * gets visibly aliased whenever the camera zooms or sub-pixel positions
 * the label.
 *
 * Simply calling `setFilter(LINEAR)` once at construction is not enough:
 * every `setText` / `setColor` / `setStyle` routes through `updateText()`,
 * which calls `canvasToTexture(...)` and resets the GL min/mag filter back
 * to NEAREST. We therefore wrap `updateText` so the LINEAR filter is
 * re-applied after every internal re-upload. Sprite textures are untouched.
