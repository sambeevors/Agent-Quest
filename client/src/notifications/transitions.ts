 *   - waiting   — status entered 'waiting' ("turn finished, your move")
 *   - completed — status entered 'completed' (session ended)
 *
 * Mid-turn errors are deliberately NOT a transition here: a failed tool call is
 * usually recovered from within the same turn, so it isn't task completion. The
 * caller folds "ended with an error" into the waiting transition instead (by
 * inspecting `lastErrorAt` when the turn actually ends), and debounces waiting
 * to drop inferred-turn-end false positives.
 *
 * Agents seen for the first time only seed the baseline and never alert — so an
 * initial snapshot or a websocket reconnect doesn't fire a burst for sessions
 * already waiting/completed. Building `next` only from current agents also drops
 * removed agents naturally.
